## How to set up
1. Clone repository and run the commands below (first commands for development, second commands without page reload)
```
yarn
yarn knex migrate:latest
yarn knex seed:run
yarn dev 


or 

yarn
yarn knex migrate:latest
yarn knex seed:run
yarn run webpack
yarn start
```
2. Take note of the .env file - you will need to add a secret here that will be used to encode JWT tokens. DO NOT commit this file, add it to a .gitignore. I left mine here for example purposes only. 

3. Routes are protected so without loggin in users will see
```
// 20190216221847
// https://reduxauthcats.herokuapp.com/api/v1/cats

{
  "message": "Access to this resource was denied.",
  "error": "No authorization token was found"
}
```

## Is this deployed? 
Yes, please check out https://reduxauthcats.herokuapp.com/  (Note: may take 20 seconds to load as it's on a free server)

## Can I improve this code
Certainly! I quickly created this without making it perfect. The idea was to include some mistakes or less efficient methods to encourage students to submit pull requests.

I haven't styled anything so please help me with that too :) Not only will this give you activity on GitHub but it was also improve this exercise for future cohorts. 

## Questions / ideas? 
Submit and issue to this repository and I'll check it out
